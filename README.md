# Operator

An application to manage data structures through a web interface.


## Install

You may use a prebuilt binary from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alinex/rust-operator/releases) page.

Alternately, it can just be installed with cargo, the rust language package manager:

    # install rust and cargo from http://rustup.rs first
    cargo install operator
    # add ~/.cargo/bin to your PATH if not already done


## Idea

- CLI Interface
- Webserver
